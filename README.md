## Filled To The Brim


This Mod Was made in part with [Fallen Breath's Multi Version Mod Template](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/fabric-mod-template)

This Mod allows empty Shulker Boxes to be put inside other Shulker Boxes.

### This mod is data driven, using datapack tags to control the mod. 

**To Enable the mod you need to download [this](https://maven.lemonlime.tech/snapshots/fttb-enable-v2.zip) pack and enable it in game.**



*If you want to disable the mod with magenta boxes (for things like easier box sorting), you can get it [here](https://maven.lemonlime.tech/snapshots/fttb-magenta_not_empty-v2.zip)*




**If the mod does not work with the datapack, redownload the datapack and update the mod**

(datapack v1 is for 1.2.2 and below, all further versions use atlead v2)
